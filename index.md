### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} global catalog 
New as of: 27 July 2017

Expanding on the last console update to manage your public regions from a single location in the console, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} now has a global catalog making the process of selecting and deploying items you select from the catalog a more streamlined process. Regardless of the region you have selected in the console, you can now see all services that are available across all public regions from your catalog. Once you select a tile from the catalog, you can see which regions the service is available in, and select where you want to deploy it.

For more information about the latest updates to the catalog, see [A global {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog makes building things easier](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/07/global-bluemix-catalog-makes-building-things-easier/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

### {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console updates
New as of: 23 May 2017

You can now manage your public regions from a single location through the updated {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. The region selector offers you streamlined access to your resources, and other enhancements include higher availability and improved performance.

### Identity and access management
New as of: 01 May 2017

With the latest updates and improvements, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account owners or administrators can now use a new unified access control UI to take advantage of the following capabilities:
 * Manage users' fine-grained access to Kubernetes services and other services as they adopt the new access control features
 * Assign service policies and Cloud Foundry roles to users within their organizations

Additionally, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform users can create, delete, and list API keys associated with their user IDs. And platform users can use those API keys to authenticate when using APIs or CLIs.

Lastly, weâ€™ve enhanced our unified user management capability to ensure that in a linked IaaS-PaaS account, users are managed in a unified way with no need to add users separately in the SoftLayer Customer Portal or the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.

For more information about the recent update, check out the [Introducing Identity & Access Management](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/05/introducing-identity-access-management/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon") blog post.

### August updates for the administration console
{: #augustadminconsole}
New as of: 31 August 2017

With the latest updates and improvements from August, you can use the following new features:

#### Updates to {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} service usage metrics

  * The computation of usage metrics for {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} has been updated to reflect the total amount of GBs used and available across all nodes in a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} cluster. Typically, a {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} cluster contains 3 nodes, and a document in the database is replicated across all the nodes in the cluster for high-availability and disaster recovery. With the August updates, the capacity metric in the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} dial (available in the _Resource Usage > Services_ view) indicates the space across all the nodes in the cluster. For example, if a single {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} cluster contains 3 nodes, each with 1000 GB capacity, the capacity limit will be 3000 GB. If 1500 GBs of that capacity have been used, the {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} usage metric will be 50%.
 
#### Updates to the scheduling of maintenance updates
  
  * In {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated, customers can manage the dates and times when their dedicated environments are available for deployment of system updates. Customers can define availability windows representing dates and times when maintenance updates can and cannot be deployed to their Dedicated environment. In the August update, _Available Update Windows_ have been renamed _Update Windows_, and _Unavailable Update Windows_ have been renamed _Blackout Windows_. Beyond the terminology changes, customers now have more flexibility and margin for defining blackout (unavailable) dates. Once requested, blackout dates will require IBM approval, and the time it takes to gain approval will vary. When the requested blackout dates are approved, IBM will cancel any existing updates that are currently scheduled during the unavailable window. IBM will also create new records for these updates and schedule them outside the approved blackout dates.

#### Updates to resource usage history capabilities

  * In the previous update (June), the History view for memory and disk usage had introduced display of usage data over the last 48 hours, 30 days, and 5 mohths. In this latest July update, the resource usage history functionality has been expanded to allow customization of the time span for which to show resource usage data. Hourly, daily and monthly views remain, but users can now specify a start day/time and duration for which to display memory and disk usage metrics (for example, showing memory usage for 15 days starting on July 1st 2017).
  * A new CLI command has been introduced to display resource metrics history in the CLI. The parameters of the command, as well as usage examples can be found by typing the following: `_cf ba resource-metrics-history -help_`

## Services
{: #services_category}

### New {{site.data.keyword.iva_full}} experimental service
New as of: 15 September 2017

With the new {{site.data.keyword.iva_full}} experimental service, you can create a cognitive voice agent built on Watson services that customers can call and speak to over the phone. With Watson artificial intelligence at its backbone, your voice agent can communicate in a conversational manner, handling complex interactions and solving customer calls within the voice agent.

{{site.data.keyword.iva_short}} seamlessly connects to and orchestrates the Watson {{site.data.keyword.speechtotextshort}}, {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}, and {{site.data.keyword.texttospeechshort}} services to simulate natural-language conversation. Each voice agent automatically scales to handle multiple calls at the same time. In this experimental release, you can customize your voice agent by using the following key features:

* Import the sample {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} dialog to get started, then create your own dialog to fit your company's needs.
* Program voice agent behavior from within the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service by using our APIs. You control everything from barge-in behavior to hanging up the call for any node in your dialog.
* Easily create and manage multiple voice agents if you want to connect different phone numbers to cognitive agents that are specialized for different topics.
* Expand the service's capabilities by connecting a service orchestration engine (SOE) so you can use third-party APIs. For example, the SOE can listen for triggers from the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service, then use your provided APIs to look up information in existing systems or provide other analysis.

To get started, see the [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.iva_short}}](/docs/services/voice-agent/getting-started.html) documentation.
